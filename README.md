# go-sql-driver-rds-credentials

Use AWS Secrets Manager with Go for automated database credential rotation without downtime.

# Usage

```go
import (
  "github.com/a-h/go-sql-driver-rds-credentials/store"
  "github.com/a-h/go-sql-driver-rds-credentials/connector"
)

func main() {
	s, err := store.NewRDS("secret_ARN", "databaseName", map[string]string{
		"parseTime":       "true",
		"multiStatements": "true",
		"collation":       "utf8mb4_unicode_ci",
	})
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("error:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	c := connector.New(s)
	db := sql.OpenDB(c)
	err := db.Ping()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("error:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	fmt.Println("OK")
}
```

# Structure

* /connector
  * See `/test/main.go` for an example which uses the connector instead of passing a DSN directly to `db.Open`.
* /store
  * Uses the AWS SDK to load secrets and to cache them locally as per the Java example provided by AWS. It also unmarshals the RDS secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager back into a DSN for use with the Go MySQL driver.
  * The contents of the `cmd` directory contain an example of retrieving secrets from AWS.
* /test
  * Contains an example of connecting to MySQL using the connector, but with a file-based implementation of the credential store (instead of using the AWS SDK).

# Manual testing

* `cd test`
* Run `docker-compose up` to start a local MySQL database.
* It will create a user called `gotest` initialised to password `first_pwd`.
* Run `main.go`
* The connection will be made and data inserted as the first test. This will be successful.
* The code then pauses and waits for enter to be pressed. At this point, you can change the user's password using MySQL workbench or CLI.
  * If the user's password is not changed, then the subsequent code fails to logon.
  * If the user's password is then changed (`SET PASSWORD FOR 'gotest' = PASSWORD('new_pwd');`), the subsequent code works fine. Hit Ctrl-C or press enter to exit the program.
